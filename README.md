# Class Material
material for computer science, java and algorithm course CSE007

Here is the check-list of things to install prior to our first course tomorrow. ''READ CAREFULLY''. Some of this apply to Mac, some linux, some Windows. READ FIRST. We roughly follow the guidelines provided here [https://github.com/jfiksel/github-classroom-for-students] for another class of another language. We do the same (expect for RStudio replaced by IntellJ IDEA) and stop there ([https://github.com/jfiksel/github-classroom-for-students#steps-for-downloading-and-editing-assignments-from-github-classroom]). So you can use this as a reference.

## 1 - GitHub account
	''why?'' To download and upload your exercises and project on a developer platform
	''how?'' simply head to [https://github.com/] and register yourself. The email you use for that is not important so it does not have to be Lehigh. If you use Lehigh though you can get special offer with GitHub education. You will use GitHub a lot in your education/professional life. We recommend using a username that incorporates your name (mine is fpfaende)

## 2 - a Java software
	**why?** We will study computer science through Java language, so we need a software that understand java code and help you write it.
	**how?** Go to [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea-edu/] and get _IntellJ IDEA_. Install it

## 3 - GIT
	**why?** You will write code on your computer and then push it to GitHub. You will also get code from GitHub and modify it on your computer. So we need a protocol to talk between GitHub and your computer. This protocol is GIT. Git is a command line tool, which means it hides in a terminal and we talk to it using actual text command. On Mac/Linux, you get the terminal by opening the terminal app; On windows you get it by selecting run from the start menu and running cmd command. The thing is, Windows is bad at command line so you will have to download a new command line software called git-bash to do GIT.
	**how?** In 3 steps (the guide is for R but it is perfect for java too, just ignore the R stuff):
	1. Follow the guideline provided in [https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html].
	2. Once you have git, introduce yourself with your github [https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html]
	3. The **MOST COMPLICATED PART** is that once git is there, it will ask you for your credentials all the time. But we can exchange keys between our computer and GitHub so that they know each other and stop asking. To do so, carefully follow instructions from [https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html]
ATTENTION, only follow the **SHELL** option (Shell is command line), not RStudio (equivalent of Intellij IDEA that you dont have)

 _This part is JAVA only so it is not on the [https://github.com/jfiksel/github-classroom-for-students]_

## 4 - Grable (optional)
	**why?** Grable is a tool to help you check your code. You write, it check for mistakes. We use it to automatically check your work every week on github.
	**how?** Follow instructions there [https://gradle.org/install/]
